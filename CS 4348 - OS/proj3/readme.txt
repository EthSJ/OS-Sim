Next, be sure all the files are together in a nice little isolated folder. Otherwise you might override if I've named it something the same as someone else. Also it's just nice to be organized and not have to hunt down files or give a large path to get to. But I'm a readme file, don't take advice from me if you don't want to.

Next, type in the generalized string "javac proj3.java".
If you don't have javac, goto step 1.
If you are getting problems about the files, well. . . be REAL specific on where they are.
If the terminal gives back nothing, well. . . you broke it. Same if you're writing this on paper. I can't fix that.

Next, type in the generalized string "java proj3 # (#)" where # and (#) are a file name and an instruction name, not the same, that coordinate to the file to read instructions from, and what scheduling you'd like
To run from jobs.txt and HRRN for example, you might type, "java proj3 jobs.txt HRRN"
Do NOT worry about case in the schedule. DO worry about such in the file name.

Suggestions:
Please remain in your homes, if you are not at home, find shelter immediately. Close all blinds and shades, block out all windows.
Do not look outside.
Do not look at the sky.
Do not make noise.
Your cooperation is vital to your survival. Appointed Foundation personnel will update you shortly after containment has been facilitated.
DO remember to use "rm -f *.class *~" to clean up afterwards. goto step 1 to run again.
