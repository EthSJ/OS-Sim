Files included:
this file (readme)
the summary (summary_exj140630)
the project 1 main file (proj1.java)
the memory file (IMem.java. Named because to me it appears to be an instruction mem)

How to compile:

Next, be sure all the files are together in a nice little isolated folder. Otherwise you might override if I've named it something the same as someone else. Also it's just nice to be organized and not have to hunt down files or give a large path to get to. But I'm a readme file, don't take advice from me if you don't want to.

Next, type in the generalized string "javac proj1.java IMem.java".
If you don't have javac, goto step 1.
If you are getting problems about the files, well. . . be REAL specific on where they are.
If the terminal gives back nothing, well. . . you broke it. Same if you're writing this on paper. I can't fix that.

4
Next, type in the generalized string "java proj1 sample(#).txt (#)" where (#) are both numbers, not the same, that coordinate to the sample text number and the timeout.
To run the 3rd for example, you might type, "java proj1 sample3.txt 23"
Do NOT replace the octothorps with letters, except the first one if you've got something like sampleA.txt, sampleB.txt, etc.

Suggestions:
Do NOT wear a hat while running these. You'll thank me for that later.
DO remember to use "rm -f *.class *~" to clean up afterwards. goto step 1 to run again.
Do remember seriously, no hats. All I've had is troubles when running this while wearing a hat.
