Next, be sure all the files are together in a nice little isolated folder. Otherwise you might override if I've named it something the same as someone else. Also it's just nice to be organized and not have to hunt down files or give a large path to get to. But I'm a readme file, don't take advice from me if you don't want to.

Next, type in the generalized string "javac proj2.java".
If you don't have javac, goto step 1.
If you are getting problems about the files, well. . . be REAL specific on where they are.
If the terminal gives back nothing, well. . . you broke it. Same if you're writing this on paper. I can't fix that.

Next, type in the generalized string "java proj2 # (#)" where # and (#) are both numbers, not the same, that coordinate to the number of doctors (1 to 3) and patients (1 to 30).
To run the 3 doctors and 5 people for example, you might type, "java proj2 3 5"
Do NOT replace the octothorps with letters.

Suggestions:
It might behoove you to make sure you didn't leave your sense of humor at home when grading this
Some knowledge of customer service makes this so much better.
Do NOT drink juice while running these. You'll thank me for that later.
DO remember to use "rm -f *.class *~" to clean up afterwards. goto step 1 to run again.
Do remember seriously, no juice. All I've had is troubles when running this while drink juice.
